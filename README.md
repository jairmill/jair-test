Hey everyone, My name is Jordan Miller and I have recently taken a introduction coding class. I am excited to learn about computer science and how I can incorporate it into my own life, and the many aspects that come with the way I live. I am currently a special education for math and english. I am a certified personal trainer. I am a licensed school counselor. I am an athlete. I am a husband to a wonderful and beautiful wife. I am a father to a wonderful and beautiful son. I am a dreamer. I am a learner. With all that I am I want to be able to express myself through the art that is computer science! I love art and expression! Computer science is an art form that is developing rapidly and requires more participation than it already has. I am really hoping to use this resource to learn about coding and collaborating with others to create art through computer science that will impact the world in a positive way.
